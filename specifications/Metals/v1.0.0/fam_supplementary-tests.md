|---------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Non-Destructive | Ultrasonic, Radiographic, Magnetic Particle | Boolean/String | Defect detection |
| Metallographic | Microstructure, Inclusion Rating | String/Numeric | Quality assessment |
| Corrosion | Salt Spray, Pitting, Intergranular | Numeric/String | Durability |
| Surface | Coating thickness, Adhesion | Numeric/Boolean | Coating quality |
| Dimensional | Straightness, Flatness, Profile | Numeric | Geometric conformance |
| Special | Customer-specific, Prototype tests | Various | Specific requirements |

### Sub-aspects

Break down into specific components:

#### Sub-aspect 1: Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)

## Validation Rules

### Required Validations

- All tests must follow universal Measurement schema
- Test method or procedure must be specified
- Pass/fail criteria should be clear
- For qualitative results, grading scales must be defined
- Inspector qualifications may be required for certain tests

### Format Validations

- NDT results often use specific classification systems
- Inclusion ratings follow standard charts (e.g., ASTM E45)
- Corrosion test duration must include units
- Coating thickness typically in micrometers or mils
- Geometric tolerances follow GD&T standards

### Business Rules

- NDT often requires certified operators
- Acceptance criteria vary by application
- Some tests are informational only
- Customer approval may override standard criteria
- Witness testing may be required
- Frequency of testing varies by criticality

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases

1. **Quality Assurance**: Verify product meets all requirements
2. **Customer Satisfaction**: Meet specific customer needs
3. **Defect Detection**: Find internal/surface defects
4. **Process Validation**: Confirm manufacturing quality
5. **Failure Prevention**: Identify potential problems
6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet industry-specific requirements
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Monitor process capability

## Notes

### Implementation Notes

- Result types vary widely - flexibility is key
- Some tests produce images or charts (store as attachments)

### Extensibility

This FAM provides a framework for recording any supplementary test using the universal Measurement structure. New test types can be added by specifying:
- Appropriate property identification
- Result type that fits the test output
- Test method and conditions
- Acceptance criteria
- Interpretation guidelines

The flexible structure accommodates:
- Standard industry tests
- Customer-specific requirements
- New test methods as they develop
- Various result formats

### Related Aspects

- Measurements (base structure for all tests)
- Product Specification (defines required tests)
- Standards Compliance (test methods)
