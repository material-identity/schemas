# Digital Material Passport Forestry Source

The DMP for Forestry ecosystem consists of two complementary schemas:

1. **ForestrySource Schema** 
   
   Documents the origin of the timber at the point of harvest, including geographical coordinates, harvest permits, and species information.

2. **Forestry Schema**
   
   Tracks forest products throughout the supply chain, linking back to source information and providing documentation for each transaction.

Together, these schemas create a complete chain of custody from forest to final product.

## Documentation
