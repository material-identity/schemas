# CoA

EN 10204 specifies the types of inspection certificates by which manufacturers declare the compliance of steel products to either product standards or customer specifications. In the absence of norms, other metals and plastics manufacturers have adopted EN 10204 to issue Certificates of Analysis, short CoA. The `./schema.json` is an implementation of the CoA.

## Changelog (v0.4.1)

- Added `product` object to the schema to describe the product details.
