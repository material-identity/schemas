2. Email your findings to [security@materialidentity.org]. 
3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
   - The steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any proof-of-concept code
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Suggested fixes if available

### What to Expect

- We will keep you informed of our progress.
- After the issue is resolved, we will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Best Practices

### Code Review Requirements

- All code changes must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
- Security-sensitive changes require review by two maintainers
- No direct commits to main branch
- Signed commits required for all contributions

### Dependency Management

- Regular automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Weekly security scanning of dependencies with socket.dev
- Automated vulnerability notifications
- Strict version pinning for production dependencies

### Authentication & Access

- Two-factor authentication required for all maintainers
- Regular audit of repository access permissions
- Use of fine-grained personal access tokens
- No sharing of access credentials
- Signing of all commits via PGP enforced

### Build and Deployment

- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Separate staging and production environments
- Automated testing for security configurations
- Regular security audits of deployment processes

### Code Quality

- Automated static code analysis
- Regular security-focused code reviews
- No sensitive information in repository
- Strict input validation requirements

## Security Update Process

1. Security patches will be released as soon as possible for all supported versions
2. Emergency patches will be fast-tracked through our release process
3. Users will be notified through GitHub Security Advisories

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We kindly ask security researchers to:

- Allow us reasonable time to resolve the issue before public disclosure
- Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service interruption
- Only interact with test accounts you own
- Delete any data obtained during research

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a bug bounty program. However, we deeply appreciate the work of security researchers and will publicly acknowledge all responsibly disclosed findings.

## Compliance

This security policy follows industry best practices and aims to comply with:
- OWASP Security Guidelines
- CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors
- GitHub's Responsible Disclosure Policy
